Yes, I used deepfriedmemes.com to make the creepy lemon man, and the bg of week 5.
It's not as easy as you think though.

1. go to the website deepfriedmemes.com
2. open up photo editor with layers idk
3. green screen the thing you want to screw up.
4. remove the green screen with the magic wand tool (can be finicky)
5. blang, you've got yourself the creepy shit.
