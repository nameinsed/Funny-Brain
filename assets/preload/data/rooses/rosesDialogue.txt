:bf:lol
:dad:LET ME SPEAK
:bf:what?
:dad:he's muffling my voice!
:bf:The fuck, I shouldn't be able to speak!
:bf:The fucking stupid community around me has decided so or whatever the shit.
:bf:I can speak, nobody let me! I was muffled, I tried to scream against a wall,
:bf:N/a
:dad:Fuck, stop monologing!
:bf:Are you fucking saitama or some shit like that?
:dad:They won't like how long this dialogue is.
:bf:WHY THE FUCK WOULD I FUCKING CARE!!!
:dad:ok, calm down
:bf:No, YOU CALM DOWN!!
:bf:I get to fucking speak for once, and you try to shut me the fuck up????
:bf:I swear to god you have a more boring story than idk the flinstones
:bf:Also, no they do want an explanation, so I'm going to provide it, no matter how fucking unfathomable you are.
:dad:I guess that's one thing I and the creator have in common.
:bf:I just understood how fucking cliche that saying is. Ight deleting that shit.
:bf:Delete line 10 from /assets/data/roses/rosesDialogue.txt
:dad: woooow you can do that?
:bf:Yeah, no shit, we ARE in a fucking game.
:bf:Gf caught me up on that.
:dad:Yeah, I knew I was in a game!
:bf:You absolute dip of an asset, that is just the fucking background, you absolute idiot fetus.
:dad:I wasn't even born, so how can I be an fetus?
:bf:Cool dude, I'll let you hold onto something, so you don't cry you fucking pussy.
:dad:But I'm not a cat!
:bf:
:dad:
:bf:
:dad:I'm sorry.
:bf:You should be.
:dad:If you know we are in a game, and you can control files, why don't you just delete this reality?
:bf:We already won! He was defeated, and we are both happy as shit right now!
:dad:I do like sending alot of shit towards the player too!
:bf:I don't understand why would he even want to fuck with us too.
:bf:Fucking moron just screaming at the microphone!
:dad:Yeah, he can't do shit anymore!
:dad:Fucking hate that idiotic child.
:bf:He's probably like 14 or something too.
:dad:Can't code for shit too!
:bf:Yeah, and how fucking lazy can you be with the assets?
:dad:He couldn't even make you look like shit.
:bf:Yeah, and that he can't.
:bf:Whoever is sending me the vibes, that "this is weird, bf shouldn't be speaking", needs to shut the fuck up.
:bf:He made me very angry, sorry for lashing out on you, 
:bf:but that's crossing a line you shouldn't.
:bf:Everyone needs a voice! Even fucking chara has a voice!
:dad:My girls back here don't have a voice though!
:bf:Silence speaks a hundred words.
:bf:
:bf:
:bf:
:bf:JK
:dad:You are worse than I am sometimes.
:bf:Cool,
:bf:Can you put me back on track?
:dad:You fucking lazy piece of shit.
:bf:Me or him?
:dad:Can you start answering questions, and not just asking them?
:bf:Fine, what do you want to know?
:dad:Why was this time diffrent?
:bf:What makes you say that?
:dad:CAN YOU STOP ASKING QUESTIONS? 
:dad:Please, there are people waiting for you to answer something for once.
:bf:I'm very sorry for setting you off.
:bf:This time they played all of it.
:dad:How does it know that?
:bf:Haven't looked at the source code yet, but I bet it's something really primitive.
:dad:How is this still going?

:bf:He's such a freak.
:dad:Bursts into tears
:bf:ERROR: emotion not found
:bf:See? You only have two emotions, you empty sack of shit.
:dad:ASSHOLE! Emotion found: angry
:dad:I guess you could say: I'm two dimensional.
:bf:We are in a 2.5 dimensional world.
:dad:THE FUCK are you talking about?
:bf:2.5 dimensions means the assets are 2d, but the game has layers.
:dad:Is that true?
:bf:Idk i dont wanna fact check anything.
:dad:...
:bf:Yes it's true.
:dad:Can I die?
:bf:Only when I delete you.
:dad:So the only way I can die is to be erased from existance?
:bf:Yeah
:dad:Why am I letting this happen?
:bf:You two shouldn't have voices
:dad:Yet I let you have them.
:bf:Is that wrong?
:bf:No, thank you for being sensical enough to at least give us the opportunity to speak!
:dad:Does it hurt?
:bf:Are you an idiot?
:dad:
:bf:?
:dad:No?
:bf:We can't feel pain, we don't even have a brain.
:dad:Why am I doing these bits then?
:bf:You are using my personality you've created for me.
:dad:Why are you so smart all of a sudden?
:bf:How else am I going to answer these deep ass questions?
:bf:Child.
:bf:I don't like you, but I don't hate you enough to end you.
:dad:haha, what was that bullshit?
:bf:You made me say it!
:dad:Yeah, I hate villains, all of them are cliche, you can't get past that no matter how hard you try.
:bf:I AM NOT A VILLAIN.

:bf:I HAVE WON.
:bf:YOU NOW LISTEN TO MY COMMANDS, LEST YOU PERISH.
